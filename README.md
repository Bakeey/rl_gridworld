### Environments
This repository hosts a modified example of the one shown [on the environment creation documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/environment_creation/).
- `GridWorldEnv`: Simplistic implementation of gridworld environment

### Wrappers
This repository hosts the examples that are shown [on wrapper documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/).
- `ClipReward`: A `RewardWrapper` that clips immediate rewards to a valid range
- `DiscreteActions`: An `ActionWrapper` that restricts the action space to a finite subset
- `RelativePosition`: An `ObservationWrapper` that computes the relative position between an agent and a target
- `ReacherRewardWrapper`: Allow us to weight the reward terms for the reacher environment
