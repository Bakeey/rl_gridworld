    "From a set initial state (charging port), the robotic vacuum cleaner gets positive rewards\n",
    "for cleaning dirty surfaces (i.e. everytime it visits a new state) and negative rewards for recleaning\n",
    "previously cleaned surfaces (i.e. states it has visited before). Additionally, a smaller\n",
    "negative reward can be used to penalize time or battery usage. The episode ends after the\n",
    "whole room is cleaned (all states visited, large positive terminal reward) or if the battery\n",
    "runs out (after some fixed time, large negative terminal reward).\n",
